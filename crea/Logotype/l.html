            During my years of study I had the opportunity to do a lot of creation. Here you can discover the different logos I created for different school projects.
            <br>

                    This logo was made for a project in my school in Denmark during my Erasmus. The subject was to create a free application. I chose to create an application for drawing amateurs.

                    The goal of this application was to allow to get drawing lessons according to the level. Here is the logo I created for the application. 
                </p>

                <p class = "text_content">
                    This logo was also made for a project at my school in Denmark, EASV. This was a week long challenge. The advertiser of this project was a Danish theater group called 7 Kanten. 

                    We realized a complete communication strategy with my team, we were 3. Here is the logo I made for our project, "tell me a story".
                </p>

                    Here, it is again a project done for my school in Denmark. The project was simply to make an icon for an application. The application was made for a museum.<br>
                    <br>
                    After studying different artistic trends, I chose to make a logo that would take the artistic trend called Bauhaus. This artistic movement was created in 1919 and is composed of simple and efficient forms and new materials. Here is why I realized this logotype inspired by this artistic current.

                <p class = "text_content">
                    This logo was made for a challenge in my school, ISCOM in France. The goal of the challenge was to create a logo for a cooking and service school.<br>
                    <br>
                    Here there are two different types of logos. The idea was to take the aesthetics of the kitchen with the inspiration of the architectures of Rouen.

                    This logo was made for a challenge in my school, ISCOM in France. The challenge had as subject to create communication integrated to the city of Rouen for the young people. My team and I had worked more particularly on the bikes. <br>
                    Here you can see the logo of this project, « Le cercle " with the slogan "enter the circle". The idea was to have a logo that corresponds to an age group of 8 to 12 years.

                    This logo was made for a challenge in my school, ISCOM in France. The advertiser for this project was the brand France 3. The project was to make politics accessible for young people (16-25 years old). We realized the JEMS project with the idea to create explanatory videos in different formats.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks to this project we ended up being the jury's favorite. The logo was created in order to be dynamic and attractive for young people.                 </p>

                    This logo was made for a challenge in my school, ISCOM in France. The objective was to create an application with imposed words, "honey" and "cap". We decided to make an application to organize the perfect honeymoon "cap vers votre lune de miel".<br>
                    <br>
                    I made this logo with a bee to remind the honey, it is golden because its wings form rings like the wedding rings.

                    This logo was made for a challenge in my school, ISCOM in France. The goal of this challenge was to create an improvement for the French brand SNCF. We decided to create a "wallet" application that would allow to earn points according to the number of trips.<br>
                    <br>
                    I realized this logo by taking the current logo of the SNCF and modifying it a little bit to add a wallet effect.

                    This logo was made for a challenge in my school, ISCOM in France. It was a Spanish project where we had organized an event to taste Cuban food in Rouen. <br>
                    <br>
                    I made this logo is colorful and dynamic to attract the eye and interest.
